# Project Specification for Maxwell's Search Engine

## Project Overview

Maxwell's Search Engine is a static HTML website designed to act as a personal "default search engine" landing page. Instead of performing real searches, this site will intercept search queries and help break the habit of relying on traditional internet search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Kagi, Bing, etc.). The site will be deployed to GitHub Pages and configured as the default search engine in your browser.

## Project Goals

- Provide a static landing page that accepts a search query via the URL.
- Help the user break the habit of using internet search engines by redirecting search attempts here.
- Serve as a gentle interruption or alternative when the user tries to search for something.
- Be easy to deploy and configure as a browser's default search engine.
- Lay the groundwork for future enhancements to handle queries in creative or helpful ways.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML document, accepts and displays the search query.
- **styles.css**: CSS for layout and appearance.
- **script.js**: JavaScript for handling query strings and any interactivity.
- **spec.md**: This specification file.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and setup instructions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push the project to a GitHub repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
3. Set the branch to deploy (usually `main`).
4. Configure your browser to use the deployed site as its default search engine.

## Future Enhancements

- Decide what happens when a query is received (e.g., display a message, offer alternatives, log queries, etc.).
- Add motivational or educational content to help break the search habit.
- Improve accessibility and responsiveness.
- Add more pages or features as needed.
